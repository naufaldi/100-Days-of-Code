Hello World! You are about to witness the beginning of an epic 100-day coding journey: A story that great sages will pass down from generation to generation. This quest will feature a potpourri of unfiltered joy, unrivaled pain, and unexpected epiphanies.

Some moments, I will feel like the smartest man alive. Others moments, I will feel like a stupid idiot. But each day, I will be a valiant warrior, fighting to improve my development skills on my mission to getScript('Or Die Tryin').
 
Without further ado, I present **#100DaysofCode with _Naufaldi Rafif S_**.
