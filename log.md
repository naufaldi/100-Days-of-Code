Hello World! You are about to witness the beginning of an epic 100-day coding journey: A story that great sages will pass down from generation to generation. This quest will feature a potpourri of unfiltered joy, unrivaled pain, and unexpected epiphanies.

Some moments, I will feel like the smartest man alive. Others moments, I will feel like a stupid idiot. But each day, I will be a valiant warrior, fighting to improve my development skills on my mission to getScript('Or Die Tryin').
 
Without further ado, I present **#100DaysofCode with _Naufaldi Rafif S_**.

**Today's Progress**: Continue learning javascript in wesbos. Now i am in 27th video and still watch and learning until 30 Video. Hope this day can reach it

**Thoughts**  : Because i am in myvillage, its really hard to get some connection to internet. in myvillage there is no signal even for 3G and mywifi still using speedy(copper cable not fiber optic). This make me unproductive.
